### Hi I'm David 👋

I'm a software and currently I'm working at Loggi (Unicorn) in São Paulo - Brazil. I like algorithms, data structures and Machine Learning.

🎓 I'm graduated in Computer Engineering at University of Campinas (UNICAMP) - São Paulo, Brazil

📚 I'm interested in algorithms in data structures and machine learning.

😅 Fun fact: I went to South East Asia in 2016 (Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia). During my trip, I met a lot of people from different countries. I like to know new cultures.
